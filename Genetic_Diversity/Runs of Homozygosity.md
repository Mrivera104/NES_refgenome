# Calculating Runs of Homozygosity (NROH, SROH, and FROH)
To get a better understanding of genetic diversity across the genome of the northern elephant seal, I used VCFtools to help me visualize any potential long runs of homozygosity that are indicative of recent and rampant inbreeding. I feel like my SNP density plots showed long stretches of ROH, but who knows, really.
