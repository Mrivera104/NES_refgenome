# Estimating nucleotide diversity of the northern elephant seal and comparing across marine mammal taxa
I performed an extensive literature review of papers that had nucleotide diversity (pi) values for a variety of different marine mammal taxa. I stuck to papers that only used whole-genome sequencing and NOT microsat assays or used mitochondrial genome diversity. These values were kind of hard to find... They only exist for a limited amount of marine mammal taxa, which is more or less expected. A majority of these values came from papers that dealt with cetacean genomics. Some values, however, were retrieved from other previously-compiled nucleotide diversity values, such as Robinson et al 2016 and Morin et al 2020.
